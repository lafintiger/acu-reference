# Contributing to AcuReference

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AcuReference! This project serves Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners worldwide, so contributions must maintain the highest standards of clinical accuracy and professional quality.

## üéØ **Core Principles**

### **Clinical Accuracy First**
- All point locations must follow WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations
- Treatment protocols must be evidence-based
- Safety information (contraindications) is critical
- Sources must be cited for all clinical claims

### **Professional Quality**
- Code must meet production standards
- UI/UX should be clinical and professional
- Performance must support real-world clinical use
- Accessibility is required (WCAG compliance)

### **International Standards**
- Use WHO standardized nomenclature
- Support multiple measurement systems (B-cun, anatomical landmarks)
- Consider cultural sensitivity in terminology
- Maintain consistency with international TCM standards
