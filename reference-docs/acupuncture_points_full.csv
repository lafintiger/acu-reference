Principles for locating acupuncture points on the surface of the body: to locate an acupuncture point, a combined approach using literature analysis, clinical practice and actual and proportional measurement is used. In selecting literature for analysis, special importance is attached to ancient and modern literature about acupuncture point locations that has a ‘national standard’  nature, such as Huangdi Mingtang Jing, Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing, Beiji Qianjin Fang and Tongren Shuxue Zhenjiu Tujing. When descriptions of acupuncture point locations in ancient literature are not clear, the following four principles are used to determine the proper location: • Priority is given to the anatomical landmark method when it does not conform to finger -cun measurement. • f ull consideration should be given to all relevant information in the original literature about the acupuncture point and its location area, sequence and name. • When determining the location of an acupuncture point, it is important to check its location in relation to the location of other relevant points. • r elevant acupuncture point charts or models in the original literature should be referred to in order to better understand the location of the acupuncture point. 2.   Methods for locating acupuncture points on the surface of the body: Three methods are used for locating acupuncture points: • The anatomical landmark method; • The proportional bone (skeletal) measurement method; and • The finger -cun measurement method In practice, it is often neccessary to combine all three methods when locating an acupuncture point. The methods primarily used are the anatomical landmark and proportional bone (skeletal)  measurement. The finger-cun measurement can be used when it is difficult to locate the acupuncture point with the above two methods. The anatomical landmark method:This method utilizes anatomical landmarks on the surface of the body to locate acupuncture points. Anatomical landmarks may be classified into two types: fixed WHO S tandard  a CUPU n C t U r E POI nt LOC at IO n S 11 landmarks and movable landmarks. Fixed landmarks refer to protuberances or depressions formed by the joints and muscles; contours of the eyes, ears, nose and mouth; fingernails and toenails; the nipples; the navel and so on. For example, the location of GB34 is described as “anterior and distal to the head of the fibula”. Movable landmarks refer to the gaps, depressions, wrinkles and peaks which appear along with the movement of joints, muscles, tendons and skin. For example, SI19 is located in the depression formed just anterior to the centre of the tragus when the mouth is opened slightly. Locations of commonly used anatomical landmarks on the surface of the body for locating acupuncture points include: a) The 2nd rib: the rib at the same level as the sternal angle; it can be palpated inferior to the clavicle. (Fig 17) b) The 4th intercostal space: at the same level as the nipples in males. (Fig 17) c) The spinous process of the 7th cervical vertebra: the most prominent spinous process on the posterior median line of the neck, which moves with the turning of the head. (Fig 18) d) The spinous process of the 3rd thoracic vertebra: the intersection of the posterior median line and the line connecting the medial ends of the two spines of the scapulae, when the subject stands upright with arms by the sides. (Fig 18) e) The spinous process of the 7th thoracic vertebra: the intersection of the posterior median line and the line connecting the two inferior angles of the scapulae when the subject stands upright with arms by the sides. (Fig 18) f) The spinous process of the 12th thoracic vertebra: on the posterior midline, at the same level as the midpoint of the line connecting the inferior angle of the scapula with the highest point of the iliac crest when the subject stand upright with arms by the sides. (Fig 18) g) The spinous process of the 4th lumbar vertebra: the intersection of the posterior median line and the line connecting the highest points of the two iliac crests. The spinous process of the 2nd sacral vertebra: the intersection of the line connecting the inferior borders of the two posterior superior iliac spines and the posterior median line. (Fig 18) i) The sacral hiatus: at the same level as the two sacral cornu superior to the coccyx, on the posterior median line. (Fig 18) The proportional bone (skeletal) measurement method: The proportional bone (skeletal) measurement method is also used to locate acupuncture points on the body . This method uses landmarks on the body surface, general guidelines for acupuncture Point Locations 12 primarily joints, to measure the length and width of various parts of the body. acupuncture point location is based on the measurements of various parts of the body from the book Lingshu chapter on Gudu, combined with the proportional measurements created by later scholars. (the method is to divide the length between two points of particular joints into equal portions. Each portion is equivalent to one cun, and ten portions equal one chi). The primary proportional bone (skeletal) measurements of the whole body can be seen in the following table. Proportional Bone (Skeletal) Measurements (Figures 19, 20 and 21) Head and face Source from the midpoint of the anterior hairline to the mid-point of the posterior hairline ：12 B-cun Lingshu from the glabella to the midpoint of the anterior hairline：3 B-cun Shenghui Fang Between the bilateral corners of the anterior hairline on the forehead ：9 B-cun Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing Between the bilateral mastoid processes ：9 B-cun Lingshu Chest, abdomen and hypochondrium from the suprasternal notch to the midpoint of the xiphisternal junction ：9 B-cun Lingshu from the midpoint of the xiphisternal synchondrosis to the centre of the umbilicus ：8 B-cun Lingshu from the centre of the umbilicus to the superior bor-der of the pubic symphysis ：5 B-cun Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing Between the two nipples ：8 B-cun Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing Back and lumbar region Between the bilateral medial borders of the scapula: 6 B-cunZhenjiu Jiayi Jing Upper limbs from the anterior or posterior axillary fold to the   cubital crease ：9 B-cun Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing & Xunjing Kaoxue Bian from the cubital crease to the wrist crease ：12 B-cun   Lingshu WHO Standard aCUPUnCtUrE POInt LOCat IOnS 13 Lower limbs from the superior border of the pubic symphysis to the base of the patella ：18 B-cun Lingshu from the apex of the patella (the centre of the popliteal fossa) to the prominence of the medial malleolus ：15 B-cun from the lateral prominence of the greater trochanter to the popliteal crease: 19 B-cun Lingshu from the gluteal fold to the popliteal crease ：14 B- cun   Tongren Shuxue Zhenjiu Tujing from the popliteal crease to the prominence of the lateral malleolus ：16 B-cunLingshu from the prominence of medial malleolus to the sole：3 B-cun Lingshu The finger-cun measurement method: The finger-cun measurement method refers to the proportional measurement method for locating acupuncture points based on the size of the fingers of the person to be mearsured. this method is mainly used on the lower limbs. When locating an acupuncture point, the practitioner, in addition to using the proportional bone (skeletal) measurement method, may use the finger-cun measurement of the patient being measured in order to verify the standard location of the acupuncture point. Middle-finger cun: The distance between the ends of the two radial creases of the interphalangeal joints of the middle finger is taken as 1 F-cun when the thumb and the middle finger are flexed to form a circle. (Fig 22) Thumb measurement: the width of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb is taken as 1 F-cun. (Fig 23) Finger width measurement: when the index, middle, ring and little fingers of the subject are extended and closed together, the width of the four fingers on the dorsal general guidelines for a cupuncture Point Locations 14 crease of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger is taken as 3 F-cun. IV . d escription of acupuncture point locations In acupuncture point location, a vertical and horizontal coordinate method is adopted as much as possible. Using two intersecting lines to make a crossing point, first, the distance on the y-coordinate (Y axis) is determined to draw the horizontal line on the body, then the distance on the x-coordinate (X axis) is determined to draw the vertical line on the body. t he latest edition of International Anatomical Terminology  is utilized to describe the relevant anatomical parts of acupuncture point locations. t he description for acupuncture point locations does not include methods for locating the acupuncture points. n otes will be added, when required, to explain the specific body postures that are required to locate certain acupuncture points, as well as the techniques for locating body surface landmarks, proportional bone (skeletal) measurements, and the relationship with adjacent acupuncture points. t he focus of explanations for location of acupuncture points is on general body positions. Only those special body positions required for certain acupuncture points have specific notes under relevant items to explain their locations. location of acupuncture points. • a special body position required for acupuncture point location. • The proportional bone (skeletal) measurement. • Explanations of the method of locating certain anatomical landmarks. • The relationship with adjacent acupuncture points or landmark acupuncture points. • Explanations of the dif ferences in surface landmarks between different genders and individuals. V . Controversial acupuncture point locations t hrough several meetings with Member States organized by the WHO r egional Office for the Western Pacific to review the 92 controversial acupuncture point locations, 86 were standardized. However, the experts could only make a tentative decision on the six remaining points. It was agreed that further scientific research, such as multi-centred clinical trials, should be conducted on the six remaining controversial acupuncture point locations. t he six controversial acupuncture points are LI19, LI20, PC8, PC9, g B30 and g V26. Their alternative acupuncture point locations are described under “Remarks” in this document.
